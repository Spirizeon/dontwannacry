# AirDrop Alternative Documentation

## Overview

This Python script provides a simple file-sharing tool over a local network (LAN) and acts as an alternative to Apple's AirDrop. 
The application supports two modes: **server** (for receiving files) and **client** (for sending files). The server listens for 
incoming file transfer requests, while the client can connect to the server and transfer a specified file.

The script uses the `socket` library to handle network connections and `threading` to allow multiple clients to connect to the 
server simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Both the server and client devices must be connected to the same local network.
- Basic understanding of networking (for IP address input).

## File Structure

- **airdrop_alternative.py**: The main Python file for running the server or client to transfer files.

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. **Server Mode**: Run this mode on the device you wish to receive files on.
   ```bash
   python airdrop_alternative.py
   # Choose "server" when prompted
